vpic_1.1.log is the weak scaling, writing 512MB per process data to rados, with processes from 1 to 32
h5rados vol does the default chunking of 64MB, thus in case of only one process, the data will be chunked into 64MB

we will hold any chunking related result, but only do the non-chunking tests for now, so 
vpic_1.1_redo.sh is going to test the weak scaling of 1-32 processes
vpic_2.1.sh is going to test the strong scaling of only 64MB
