# H5Boss-Dev

H5Boss is designed for managing millions of astronomy files with efficient parallel I/O and scalable file manager. In h5boss-dev, we extend the functionality for multiple purposes:

1. H5Boss as a usecase for PDC at LBNL
2. H5Boss as a benchmark for various object store testbed at NERSC
3. Further optimization of H5BOSS for Astronomy community: https://github.com/valiantljk/h5boss
