1.1 Fitsio and Fits formats
1.2 H5py and HDF5 formats, 2444 converted H5Boss HDF5 v1 source files
1.3 H5py and HDF5 formats, pre-selected H5Boss HDF5 v1 file



#TODO: 
1. copy FITs files to Scratch--->Nov 3 2016 (YES)
2. memory footprint --->
3. ensure data is in memory --->checker is conducted (YES)

#NOTE: Test 1 is depended on Test 2

2.1 Use 1 nodes on Cori, 32 processes, strong scaling 
2.2 Scale from 1 node to 100 nodes, #TODO later, fix issue
2.3 #TODO Compare V1 and V2
